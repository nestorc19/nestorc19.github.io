        <h2>Information:</h2>

        <p><b>Nestor Compean Barron</b> I was born in Mexico and have lived in the US since I was eight years old. I am currently working a full time job as a AML investigator and in school to get my B.S in Information Technology. I got married to my wife a year ago and we have a lovely poodle name Milo.</p>

        <p><b>Alejandra Verastegui</b> is my wife and I admire her for the person she is. She is always a happy person and tries to be nice to everyone around her. I aspire to be like her everyday because she finds the good in everyone and everything.</p>
